# Car project: learning with RL techniques
I made this project with the colleague Francesco Romeo (https://github.com/francesco1996r). We're two MSc students in CS at "Universit√† degli Studi Di Napoli 'Federico II' " and we made this project as a final part of an exam about robotics. 
Our goal was to experiment <i>Reinforcement Learning</i> techniques in a simulated environment and for this reason we've realized a car game which purpose was to let the car learning to drive in a simple environment (drawn only by bareers). 

Our "learning experiments" were divided in 3 parts:
<ol>
  <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b> using <i>Bellman equation</i></li>
  <li><b>Deep Reinforcement Learning</b> using a <i>Convolutional Neural Network</i></li>
  <li><b>Deep Reinforcement Learning</b> using a <i>Feed-Forward Neural Network</i> with 3 layers and 512 nodes</li>
</ol>
In all the three parts, we used n-rays (starting from the front of the car) to let the car read the environment using Raycasting (just like using lasers/sonars). Any scan of the environment represented the current state on which we could work for the learning phase.
We've made this project using <b>Unity</b> and, moreover, we've used the tool <b>ML Agent</b> provided by Unity for the ANN realization.
